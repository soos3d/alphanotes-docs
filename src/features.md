## Understanding Limitations

It's essential to be aware of certain constraints when using AlphaNotes:

- **Video Length:** Videos are typically limited to 30,000 tokens, usually up to 2 hours of content; videos with a denser dialogue may reach the token limit sooner.

- **Contextual Limits:** These limitations are in place as ChatGPT's performance can degrade with excessively long texts, potentially resulting in lower quality responses and loss of context.

To ensure the best performance and quality of your summaries and notes, selecting videos within these parameters is recommended.
