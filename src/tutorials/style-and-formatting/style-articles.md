### Requesting styled notes

To begin styling your article notes, here's what you need to do:

- **Initiate:** Start a conversation with AlphaNotes by selecting it from the GPT Store or using the `@alphanotes` command within any chat.
- **Request:** Provide the link to the article you want notes for and specify your styling preferences. For example:

```
Can you generate notes for this article? https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/authentication-methods-for-different-scenarios Style the headings in sentence case. Remove the Summary section. Place the Suggested Areas for Deeper Study after the Questions & Quizzes section. Separate the correct answers from the Questions & Quizzes section and place them at the end as a separate section. Mark them as Question 1 answer: correct answer.
```

This step instructs AlphaNotes to generate notes from your article and apply the specific formatting rules you've requested, creating a customized summary that meets your needs.

Here is an example of styled versus non-styled notes:
