For a documentation-focused repository, where contributions are primarily text edits or additions, the guidance should be tailored to encourage clear, concise, and helpful documentation updates. Here's a revised version that suits a docs website:

## Running the Project Locally

To set up and run this project locally, especially if you're interested in contributing, follow the steps outlined below. These instructions will guide you through installing the necessary tools, cloning the project, and starting the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. npm is included with Node.js, which you can download and install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 1: Install Retype

Retype is a static site generator that powers our documentation site. To install Retype globally on your system, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
npm install retypeapp --global
```

For more detailed instructions on the installation process, including troubleshooting tips, visit the [Retype documentation](https://retype.com/guides/getting-started/#install).

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

To work on the project, you must have a local copy of the codebase. Clone the repository using git with the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/soos3d/alphanotes-docs
```

This command creates a copy of the project in a new directory named `alphanotes-docs` on your computer.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning, move into the project directory with the following:

```sh
cd alphanotes-docs
```

This step is crucial as all subsequent commands should be run within the project's root directory.

### Step 4: Run the Project

Finally, to start the project locally and view the documentation site in your browser, execute the following:

```sh
retype start
```

This command launches a local server and opens the project in your default web browser. If the browser does not open automatically, you can manually navigate to the URL provided in the terminal output, typically `http://localhost:5000`.

### Additional Tips

- **Watching for Changes**: Retype automatically refreshes the browser when changes to the documentation are detected. This feature allows you to see updates in real time as you edit.

- **Contributing Changes**: As you make improvements or add new information, preview your changes locally before committing. This practice helps ensure your contributions are visually and functionally consistent with the existing documentation.

If you encounter issues while setting up or running the project, please refer to the [Retype documentation](https://retype.com/documentation/) for further assistance or submit a problem in the project's GitHub repository.

## Contributions

Your insights and improvements are invaluable to us! Whether you're correcting typos, enhancing explanations, or adding new tutorials, here's how you can contribute to making our documentation even better:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This gives you your copy to work on.

2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your documentation edits in your fork. Naming the branch something descriptive about your changes, like `update-tutorial-video-summaries` or `fix-typos-in-getting-started`, can be very helpful.

3. **Edit the Documentation**: Make your proposed edits within your branch. This could include fixing typos, improving clarity, adding examples, or expanding existing sections. If you're adding a new topic, ensure it aligns with the structure and style of the existing documentation.

4. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages. This helps others understand the purpose of your edits and the rationale behind them.

5. **Preview Your Changes**: Preview your changes to the documentation to ensure they render correctly and are free of formatting errors. This might involve running the project's local development environment or using markdown preview tools.

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Push your branch to your fork and then open a pull request to the original repository. In your PR description, summarize your changes and explain how they improve the documentationâ€”link to any relevant issues your changes address.

7. **Review Process**: Once you've submitted your PR, a maintainer or a documentation team member will review your contribution. Be open to feedback, as it's common to request revisions to ensure the documentation remains consistent and clear to all users.

8. **Merge**: After reviewing and approving your PR, a maintainer will merge it into the primary documentation. Your contributions will now be live and accessible to all users!
